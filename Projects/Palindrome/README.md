#### Objective

In this assignment I will implement a palindrome class. This class will detect if a given string is a
palindrome or not (it reads the same in reverse).

#### Files 

• CMakeLists.txt - `The build system for your project. Read this file carefully.`

• palindrome.cpp - `This is where you write your main function.`

• stack.cpp - This is where you provide the implementation of Stack.

• stack.hpp - This is where you provide the definition of Stack.

• queue.cpp - This is where you provide the implementation of Queue.

• queue.hpp - This is where you provide the definition of Queue.

• input1.txt - The text file given for testing.

• output1.txt - The expected output from using the input1.txt file.
